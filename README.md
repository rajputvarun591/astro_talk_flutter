# Astro Talk Flutter | India Today Assignment

A new Flutter Assignment from India Today Group.

## Features
#### 1. Load Question categories by API using [http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http).
#### 2. Use [provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management.
#### 3. Add Family & Friends Profiles.
#### 4. Delete Friend & Family Profiles.
#### 5. Listing All Friends & Family Profiles.

## Pendings
#### 1. Due to lack oftime I haven't integrated the functionality behind the Edit button. for now edit button will edit the profile visually and creates a new profile while you tap on it. (as per backend they provide new api for update in POST request type)
